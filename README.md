## Introduction

TuniPlate aims to automate the detection and blurring of Tunisian license plates in images. This application leverages YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and utilizes Flask for handling image uploads and processing.

## Features

- **License Plate Detection:** Automatically detects Tunisian license plates in uploaded images.
- **Image Processing:** Applies blur effect to detected license plates for privacy protection.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive web interface for uploading and processing images.

## Technologies

- **Flask:** Micro web framework for Python.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** Object detection framework for real-time detection.
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library for image processing tasks.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computations in Python.

## Setup

To run TuniPlate locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv, virtualenv)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tuniplate.git
   cd tuniplate
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure Flask environment variables:

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development  # Use 'production' for production environment
   ```

2. Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.
2. Upload an image containing a Tunisian license plate.
3. TuniPlate will detect the license plate and blur it automatically.

## Endpoints

- **POST /api/process-image:** Endpoint for uploading an image and processing it to blur detected license plates.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute to TuniPlate, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
